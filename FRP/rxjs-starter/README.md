# RxJS Starter

Basic starter project for RxJS, helper for
[RxJS Basics](https://ultimatecourses.com/learn/rxjs-basics) course on
[Ultimate Courses](https://ultimatecourses.com).

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/btroncone/rxjs-starter.git
cd rxjs-starter
npm install
npm start
```

After running `npm start` you can navigate to the development server running on
`http://localhost:1234`. Any changes made to the `sample.js` file will trigger
an automatic reload.

Feel free to ping me on Ultimate Courses slack or on Twitter
[@btroncone](http://twitter.com/btroncone) if you run into any issues!
